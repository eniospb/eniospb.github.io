                    <span class="style40">by Alexander Gerdin and Kahue</span></span></p>

                  Do you believe you have lived  before? Have you ever had the feeling you have been somewhere before, when you  know in this lifetime you have not? There are very few people in the modern  world who are knowledgeable about the science of reincarnation and who can also  assist anyone in recalling their past lives. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1"> One of the first people in the  modern world who started to use a method of reincarnation recall (past life  therapy) for healing diseases, which are hard or impossible to cure by  classical medical methods, was the Russian man Boris Goldovsky. Some present  day masters use crystals to assist with past life recall, others use hypnosis  or hypnotherapy. Boris has his own special practices which have been acquired  over a lifetime of study and experience. His own daughter has become top of her  class in Germany in the German language, all the German language being self  &lsquo;taught&rsquo; with the help of father Boris, through past life therapy.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1"> Neva News had an opportunity of one  to one discussion with Boris Goldovsky and now we share some of interesting  aspects about this talented individual with our readers. Boris has managed to  explore in some detail 11 of his own prior incarnations or past lives. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>What is Reincarnation? </strong></p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">Reincarnation, also called&nbsp;Transmigration or Metempsychosis, is  referred to in scriptures of both religion and philosophy and is in effect a  rebirth of physical <a name="225280.hook" id="225280.hook"></a>existence in  one or more successive lifetimes. The physical lifetimes may be in a human,  animal, or in some other form. The proof of reincarnation lies more in the  field of faith not so much in practice, however, some people can prove and  demonstrate what they experience in a reincarnation meditation. In addition  there are well documented practices where a child has requested that the  parents take them to see a place in their past life which they recall in this  life. This individual recall seems to be more vivid when the person died in  their previous life in a sudden and tragic circumstance. There are also  specific instances where Indian Masters, such as Sri Sai Baba, have documented  who they were in a past life and when they are going to leave the present  physical life and when they are going to reincarnate again. Also the Dalai Lama  and many of his fellow Buddhist masters attest to the reality of past lives and  reincarnation.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;The  results of many world researches into reincarnation suggest that many of our  various incarnations/lives are shared often with the same relatives and  friends, in a similar circle with only the role of each person changing from  one incarnation to another. So for example, in one life a person might be a  husband, and in another life a father or a brother or a son or a friend or a  lover of the same woman, or even they both might change their sex and he can  become a wife when she can become a husband or son or daughter. &ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo;  says Goldovsky, &ldquo;this means that if a person has not solved some relationships  problems in one life, then in future lives he/she continues to interact with  the same souls and this lasts until the problem is solved.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
                <span class="style1"><strong>Boris  Goldovsky</strong>                </span>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">Dr. Boris Goldovsky is now President  of the Russian Foundation of ENIOtechnologies (energy-informational  technologies), a member of International Register of Complementary Medicine and  a winner of many international prizes such as: Chizhevsky prize (1995),  Vernadsky prize (1998), &ldquo;The Star of a Master&rdquo; (the highest prize in  complementary medicine, 2000), the Golden Medal and &ldquo;The Elite of the Folk  Medicine&rdquo; (2005). Boris Goldovsky studied psychology in All-Union Laboratory of  Suggestology and Suggestive Pedagogics in Odessa, now in Ukraine but then part of the former USSR. Boris now lives in St. Petersburg, Russia. He has held more than 800  reincarnation sessions with many different people in 23 different countries. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Reincarnation Meditation</strong></p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boris has in his library over 130  hours of unique video recordings with individual and group reincarnation  meditations. During such meditations, Boris says, &ldquo;people recalled distinctly  their previous incarnations, very brightly, to the smallest detail. These  recollections, once recalled using this method of meditation, are then kept in  the person&rsquo;s memory for a whole lifetime. Dreams are often difficult to recall  in the morning after a night dreaming, even in a fragmented form. However all  of what is reconnected within a Reincarnation Meditation remains in detail in  one's memory literally hour after hour, day after day. What is also important,  is that in the future the people who have undertaken such Reincarnation  Meditation can take themselves to different parts of their previous lives at  any time,&rdquo; Goldovsky added. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&ldquo;Reincarnation  Meditation is a deep reflection. The right meditation requires a calming of  vibrations of thought matter. It must be an absolute calm of thoughts. In India this state is  called Chitta-vritti. It can be  reached through long training utilising special  techniques,&rdquo; Boris stated. Boris uses these techniques, learned from his  extensive training, to assist his clients or colleagues in revisiting past  lives. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;&ldquo;To begin  a reincarnation meditation I use suggestion, to progress towards an altered  state of mind, leaving aside the conscious barrier. It is a speechless  influence by a particular field, a substantial part of which is an  electromagnetic field,&rdquo; says Dr Boris Goldovsky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also working now on a  device that will help people to enter this state of meditation. This device  will allow them to solve difficult problems themselves and will be a kind of  internal faultless adviser,&rdquo; added Boris.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Past Lives Affect Our Present</strong></p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">In our present  being our past lives play a great role. Almost all our problems, including  problems with our health, our relations with relatives and friends, our  appearance and particular features, according to Boris Goldovsky, have roots in  our previous lives. In previous lives they were also inherited from an earlier  life and so on. &ldquo;Some people call this a genetic memory, nevertheless this  description seems not true to me. I would call it an information memory.  Because genes are passed on from parents, but previous lives were not  necessarily with these present day parents,&rdquo; Boris explained.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;We often  appear to be deaf and blind to signs that are sent to us. It&rsquo;s difficult for us  to learn lessons from our own present life, net alone from a chain of our  previous lives. Reincarnation Meditations can help us realize the problem which  makes our life what it is, so as not to &ldquo;step on the same rake&rdquo; so many times  suggests Dr. Goldovsky.<br />
                  Most of present  day diseases relate to so called psychosomatic sources, i.e. are caused by a  mind/soul state of a person. It&rsquo;s very difficult to heal such illnesses by  classical medical methods. In medical reference books one can see that the  reasons of many serious diseases are still not defined by medicine. These  reasons often lie in the blueprint &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; from previous lives of a person.  Such difficult illnesses, which are beyond the control of the classical  medicine, can be healed through Reincarnation Meditation, which is an element  of what is today also called Psychotherapy. This method is sometimes  indispensable in curing neuroses, including sexual neuroses. &ldquo;My first results  showed a high effectiveness of reincarnation usage in healing these diseases&rdquo;,  says Boris. &ldquo;Many people first try this technique of Reincarnation Meditation  with some fear, even when we do this as part of a big group of people under my  constant management. However, after having gone through past life  experiences, including sometimes disasters and tragedies, during a  Reincarnation Meditation they often come out of this state with a delight in  eyes. Experience shows me that after a Reincarnation Meditation participants  often interrupt each other, explaining episodes of their previous lives. The  first experience in this form of meditation is often followed by a desire to  climb deeper and further through the scale of Time.</p>
